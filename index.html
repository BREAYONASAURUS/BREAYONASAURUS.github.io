	   <em>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? <br>
       Thou art more lovely and more temperate: <br>
       Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, <br>
       And summer's lease hath all too short a date: <br>
       Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, <br>
	   <!-- This was created by Breayona Reed -->
       And often is his gold complexion dimmed, <br>
       And every fair from fair sometime declines, <br>
       By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed: <br>
       But thy eternal summer shall not fade, <br>
       Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st, <br>
       Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade, <br>
       When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st, <br>
       So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, <br>
       So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</em> <br>
